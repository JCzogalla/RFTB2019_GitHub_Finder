# RFTB2019 GitHub Finder

The first project in Brad Traversy's [React Front to Back 2019](https://www.udemy.com/share/101XdqAkUadVtQTH4=/) Udemy course.

I have created a branch for every lecture in the course so if you're having problems with a specific section of the project you can checkout that branch and compare your code.

For example if you're having problems on **Section 5 lesson 27** then checkout branch **s5-27**

The master branch is the final completed project.
